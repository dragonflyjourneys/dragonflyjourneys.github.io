                    >The Syrian Rue, scientifically named Peganum Harmala, is often
                    referred to as the &ldquo;Ayahuasca&quot; of North Africa and
                    Eurasia. This plant shares certain characteristics with the
                    renowned Amazonian ayahuasca. Traditionally, it has been utilized
                    by healers to address mental health concerns, offering a
                    distinctive synergy that contributes to comprehensive treatment
                    approaches. Users often report longer lasting positive effects
                    following the experience with this plant.</span
