              through vibrations, influencing the very concept of the soul.
              There is potential to transcend physical, astral, and dream
              realms, all of which are contained within the present moment,
              encompassing both past and future. This co-creative dance of light

              origins of the first shamans and yogis remain a subject of
              fascination, as they harnessed the power of compounds like
              psilocybin, harmaline, DMT, mescaline, THC, scopolamine,
              muscarine, and ibogaine. Practices such as kambo, ayahuasca, and
