                <h2>About the Dragonfly</h2>
                <p class="lead">A wisdom mentor, holistic innovator and warrior of love, integrating healing, spirituality, education, engineering, and transformative compassion.</p>

                <p class="lead">
                  The Dragonfly's transformation began approximately 15 years
                  ago, fueled by an insatiable curiosity for the mysteries of
                  consciousness. It all started when he consumed the sacred morning
                  glory seeds (ololiuqui), revered by the Aztec and Maya
                  cultures. This initial encounter sparked a deep fascination
                  with the enchanting realm of magical plants and fungi.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                  Over the years, the Dragonfly gradually embraced these
                  mystical tools, seeking a profound connection with each one.
                  He nurtured a bond with sacred mushrooms by cultivating and
                  regularly ingesting them. Drawn to the sacred geometry of
                  cacti, he dedicated time to communing with the spirit of
                  Wachuma (San Pedro), receiving guidance that led him to
                  further explore the healing powers of the sacred Ayahuasca,
                  the grandmother of the jungle.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                  Through years of experimentation with various plant spirits
                  and recipes, the Dragonfly delved deeper into the realm of
                  healing, embarking on a personal journey of self-discovery. It
                  was during this time that the Ayahuasca grandmother guided him
                  back to the sacred mushrooms, teaching him how to delve into
                  the depths of his consciousness.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                  This revelation inspired the Dragonfly to combine the healing
                  properties of the Syrian Rue (Peganum Harmala) plant with
                  heroic doses of magic mushrooms. What followed was a period of
                  profound self-discovery and learning, as he embarked on
                  intense journeys of introspection. Along this transformative
                  path, he accumulated experiences and knowledge, which is
                  gradually transforming into wisdom.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                  Now, having emerged from his cocoon, the Dragonfly unfurls his
                  wings, ready to share the wisdom and magic he has acquired. He
                  embodies the essence of transformation, offering guidance and
                  inspiration to those who seek their own path of self-discovery
                  and healing.
